# Information Systems: MTG

A student project I made for Information Systems 2 course at Faculy of Science, University of Novi Sad. It is a web app implemented in Java, using Sring and JSP, that is used for managing the user's collection of Magic: The Gathering cards, browsing cards from all the game's sets and making decks with the cards that a user owns.
